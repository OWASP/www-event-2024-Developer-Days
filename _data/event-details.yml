    OWASP is thrilled to announce the newest extension of our Global Conferences, Developer Day on Wednesday, September 25th!<br>
    <br>
    Explore and learn how to code more securely without security getting in the way of ship it fast. Collaborate with other developers, security practitioners, industry talent and more to enrich and grow your skills!  Developers are encouraged to come and share their thoughts and opinions about security - what they’ve done, what they’re doing, what’s working, and what’s not.  It’s a safe space to share, have open and honest discussions, and learn from each other.<br>
    <br>
    If you are looking to extend your education and networking exprience, join us for the newly designed OWASP Global AppSec US Conference alongside 1200+ cybersecurity experts from September 26-27 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco in San Francisco, CA. <br>
