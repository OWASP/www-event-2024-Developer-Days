    **LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO SEND YOUR SECURITY CHAMPION AND DEVELOPERS FOR EDUCATION AND NETWORKING? NOT SURE WHERE TO SEND THEM?  
    <BR>
    This is exactly the event for this!**<br>
    <br>
    OWASP is thrilled to announce the newest extension of our Global Conferences, Developer Day on Wednesday, September 25th!<br>
    <br>
    Security professionals talk about what developers want or need all the time… but how often do we hear from developers themselves?  This event changes all of this.  Developers are encouraged to come and share their thoughts and opinions about security - what they’ve done, what they’re doing, what’s working, and what’s not.  It’s a safe space to share, have open and honest discussions, and learn from each other.<br>
    <br>
    If you are looking to extend your education and networking exprience, join us for the newly designed OWASP Global AppSec US Conference alongside 1200+ cybersecurity experts from September 26-27 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco in San Francisco, CA. <br>
    <br>
